I am a recent PhD graduate from the University of Illinois at Chicago with over 5 years of experience developing probabilistic machine learning models for complex, noisy time-series data. My research has focused on the intersection of machine learning, signal processing, and control systems, with particular expertise in Bayesian optimization for human-in-the-loop applications.
During my doctoral work, I developed heteroscedastic Gaussian Process models that achieved 23-31% RMSE reduction compared to traditional approaches, while accelerating convergence by 10Ã— in real-world exoskeleton control applications. My work with high-frequency EMG signals (1.7kHz) and large-scale datasets (4GB+) has equipped me with robust skills in real-time signal processing, uncertainty quantification, and multi-objective optimization.
Key technical achievements include:

Designed and deployed Bayesian optimization frameworks that reduced human metabolic cost by 17.2% in 11-subject clinical studies
Developed real-time EMG signal enhancement algorithms achieving +108.7% performance improvement with sub-millisecond latency
Built predictive ML models using elastic net and advanced feature engineering, improving controller selection accuracy to 75%

I am seeking challenging opportunities in machine learning where I can apply my expertise in probabilistic modeling, optimization, and signal processing to create value through data-driven solutions. I am particularly interested in roles that involve tackling complex, high-impact problems requiring rigorous mathematical modeling and innovative algorithmic approaches.
My interdisciplinary background uniquely positions me to bridge the gap between theoretical ML research and practical implementation, having successfully deployed algorithms on real hardware systems operating at 100Hz in demanding real-world conditions.
