Recent PhD graduate from UIC specializing in multi-objective optimization for wearable robotics. I bridge machine learning, biomechatronics, and human-computer interaction with 5+ years developing real-time algorithms for assistive devices in noisy, complex environments.
Built bilateral hip exoskeletons with variable impedance controllers achieving 17.2% metabolic reduction and 18.2% EMG decrease. My key innovation: a multi-objective Bayesian optimization framework that personalizes controller tuning in under 12 minutes—10× faster than traditional methods. Developed heteroscedastic Gaussian Process models to handle input-dependent noise in human physiological responses, improving prediction accuracy by 23-31%.
Core expertise: extracting patterns from high-noise biological signals. Processed 1.77kHz EMG streams with custom pipelines achieving 18.3dB SNR improvement at sub-10ms latency using Hankel decomposition and Bayesian smoothing. Through 11-subject clinical studies, discovered fundamental EMG-preference trade-offs using Pareto front analysis and Expected Hypervolume Improvement, revealing consistent task-specific strategies despite 100%+ inter-subject variability.
Seeking ML engineering roles where I can apply probabilistic modeling, signal processing, and optimization expertise to complex real-time systems. My experience with heteroscedastic modeling, uncertainty quantification, and human-in-the-loop optimization translates well to robotics, biomedical systems, financial modeling, or any domain where constant-noise assumptions fail. I excel at developing algorithms that bridge theoretical elegance with deployed system constraints.
