I am a recent PhD graduate from the University of Illinois at Chicago specializing in multi-objective optimization and control systems for wearable robotics. My research bridges machine learning, biomechatronics, and human-computer interaction, with over 5 years developing and deploying real-time optimization algorithms for assistive devices.
During my doctoral work, I designed and built bilateral hip exoskeletons using quasi-direct drive actuation, developing variable impedance controllers that reduced users' metabolic cost by up to 17.2% and muscle activity (EMG) by 18.2% compared to unassisted movement. My key innovation was implementing a multi-objective Bayesian optimization framework that simultaneously optimized physiological efficiency and user comfort, achieving personalized controller tuning in under 12 minutes—a 10× improvement over traditional methods requiring 2-4 hours.
Key technical achievements include:

Developed heteroscedastic Gaussian Process models capturing input-dependent noise in human responses, improving prediction accuracy by 23-31% over homoscedastic approaches
Built real-time control systems operating at 100Hz on embedded hardware (Raspberry Pi), implementing variable stiffness profiles using Bézier curves for smooth torque modulation
Processed high-frequency EMG signals (1.77kHz) with custom pipelines achieving 18.3dB SNR improvement while maintaining <10ms latency
Conducted 11-subject clinical studies demonstrating significant reductions in perceived exertion (34.8% for walking, 23.2% for squatting)

My work revealed fundamental trade-offs between EMG minimization and user preference through Pareto front analysis, validating the necessity of multi-objective approaches in human-centered design. I employed Expected Hypervolume Improvement for efficient exploration without requiring a priori objective weighting.
I am seeking challenging opportunities in machine learning and robotics where I can apply my expertise in probabilistic modeling, real-time optimization, and human-in-the-loop systems. My interdisciplinary background uniquely positions me to develop data-driven solutions for complex cyber-physical systems requiring both theoretical rigor and practical implementation.
